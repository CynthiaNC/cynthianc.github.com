  Yesteday, I tried to imitate some pictures that I met on Lofter,and I had a good time when drawing.Maybe it is new for me,I felt wonderful.
  Here shows my works:

  Actually,I just drew a person.But as you see,the left person got a big face in his head.So I drew another one as his wife.They really looked like  couples,I guess.
